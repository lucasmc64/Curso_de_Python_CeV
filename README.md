## How do I run the project on my machine? :thinking:

The first step is to clone the project, either via terminal or GitHub Desktop, or even by downloading the compressed file (.zip). After that, go ahead.

### Requirements :hammer_and_wrench:

> There are no requirements to perform some of the exercises on your computer! Just double click on the file with extension *.html* and it will open in your default browser.
>
> However, to run some JavaScript files individually we need some tools.

* [Python 3](https://www.python.org) installed.
* [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and the extension [Python](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python) installed.

### Running the JS files :sparkles:

Open the project folder in VSCode and, by right-clicking on the file with extension *.py*, choose *Run Python File in Terminal*. The terminal will open with the code results.

## If everything went well... :tada:

Now you are running the project beautifully!
